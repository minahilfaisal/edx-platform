    First stab at an interface for accessing XBlock User State. This will have

    Scope/Goals:

        1. Mediate access to all student-specific state stored by XBlocks.
            a. This includes "preferences" and "user_info" (i.e. UserScope.ONE)
            b. This includes XBlock Asides.
            c. This may later include user_state_summary (i.e. UserScope.ALL).
            d. This may include group state in the future.
            e. This may include other key types + UserScope.ONE (e.g. Definition)
        2. Assume network service semantics.
            At some point, this will probably be calling out to an external service.
            Even if it doesn't, we want to be able to implement circuit breakers, so
            that a failure in StudentModule doesn't bring down the whole site.
            This also implies that the client is running as a user, and whatever is
            backing it is smart enough to do authorization checks.
        3. This does not yet cover export-related functionality.

    A note on the format of state storage:
        The state for an xblock is stored as a serialized JSON dictionary. The model
        field that it is stored in can also take on a value of ``None``. To preserve
        existing analytic uses, we will preserve the following semantics:

        A state of ``None`` means that the user hasn't ever looked at the xblock.
        A state of ``"{}"`` means that the XBlock has at some point stored state for
           the current user, but that that state has been deleted.
        Otherwise, the dictionary contains all data stored for the user.

        None of these conditions should violate the semantics imposed by
        XBlockUserStateClient (for instance, once all fields have been deleted from
        an XBlock for a user, the state will be listed as ``None`` by :meth:`get_history`,
        even though the actual stored state in the database will be ``"{}"``).
